*Note: This is a revamp of [a post](http://blog.maximzaslavsky.com/2010/03/open-sourcing-music/) from my old blog. It was originally published on March 10, 2010.*

The open source movement has infiltrated many fields: software, hardware, writing. But a major one has been overlooked.

We haven't changed what currently goes on in the music industry... yet.

The open source paradigm, or at least Free As In Beer, certainly has had an effect on music, which is why many artists opt to release their music for free online. The extent is fully public-domain recordings and sound libraries.

Yet composition, the root of all music, remains unchanged. Arguably, composition is impossible to open up, since it is an embodiment of a single composer's feelings and ideas.

# Current problem

Tthe problem we're facing is two-fold:

* **Music composition is very private**: the current form of music composition limits music to being written by one or a few people.
* **Publishing is also private**: only one publishing route exists, and that is for composers who are famous and good enough to have contracts with big publishers. No Creative Commons-type alternative exists.

But what if people could work together to write music? 

**Many parts of composing are repetitive tasks, so streamlined?**

# Finding an open-source solution




# Further technicalities that need to be resolved

* How do you manage idea and style differentiation?

# Taking this further

* A Q&A site where composers can share portions of their notations and receive feedback and potential improvements
* An online Creative-Commons-licensed library of user-submitted motifs that composers can use
